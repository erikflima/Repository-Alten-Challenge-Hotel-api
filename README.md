# üçÅAlten Challenge | üèñÔ∏èCancun Hotel Booking API | üë®üèæ‚ÄçüíªBy Erik Lima

### üíªThe challenge

Post-Covid scenario:
People are now free to travel everywhere but because of the pandemic, a lot of hotels went bankrupt. Some former famous travel places are left with only one hotel.
You‚Äôve been given the responsibility to develop a booking API for the very last hotel in Cancun.

#### ‚úÖ The requirements are:

  ‚û°Ô∏è API will be maintained by the hotel‚Äôs IT department.

  ‚û°Ô∏è As it‚Äôs the very last hotel, the quality of service must be 99.99 to 100% => no downtime.

  ‚û°Ô∏è For the purpose of the test, we assume the hotel has only one room available.

  ‚û°Ô∏è To give a chance to everyone to book the room, the stay can‚Äôt be longer than 3 days and can‚Äôt be reserved more than 30 days in advance.

  ‚û°Ô∏è All reservations start at least the next day of booking.

  ‚û°Ô∏è To simplify the use case, a ‚ÄúDAY‚Äô in the hotel room starts from 00:00 to 23:59:59.

  ‚û°Ô∏è Every end-user can check the room availability, place a reservation, cancel it or modify it.

  ‚û°Ô∏è To simplify the API is insecure.
