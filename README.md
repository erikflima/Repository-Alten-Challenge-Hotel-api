# 🍁Alten Challenge | 🏖️Cancun Hotel Booking API | 👨🏾‍💻By Erik Lima

### 💻The challenge

Post-Covid scenario:
People are now free to travel everywhere but because of the pandemic, a lot of hotels went bankrupt. Some former famous travel places are left with only one hotel.
You’ve been given the responsibility to develop a booking API for the very last hotel in Cancun.

✅ The requirements are:

  ➡️ API will be maintained by the hotel’s IT department.

  ➡️ As it’s the very last hotel, the quality of service must be 99.99 to 100% => no downtime.

  ➡️ For the purpose of the test, we assume the hotel has only one room available.

  ➡️ To give a chance to everyone to book the room, the stay can’t be longer than 3 days and can’t be reserved more than 30 days in advance.

  ➡️ All reservations start at least the next day of booking.

  ➡️ To simplify the use case, a “DAY’ in the hotel room starts from 00:00 to 23:59:59.

  ➡️ Every end-user can check the room availability, place a reservation, cancel it or modify it.

  ➡️ To simplify the API is insecure.
